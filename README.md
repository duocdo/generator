#Front-end Generators
For making life of front-end developer better, I created a set of generator to serve multiple purposes. They are for front-end development only.

##Pure & Email Generator

Based on [h5bp.com](http://html5boilerplate.com/) and [its project](http://htmlemailboilerplate.com/), but more simpler.
For email, there is one more template optimized for real project, beside the original sources.

##SCSS & LESS Generator

Created by reusing and optimizing [XH Generator](https://github.com/xhtmlized/generator-xh).
It's simpler without any setup step and reduce unnecessary tasks.

###Requirement

* [Node](http://nodejs.org/)
* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)
* [Ruby for Windows](http://rubyinstaller.org/)
* [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/)
* [LESS](http://lesscss.org/)

###How to use

* `npm install` to set up project
* `grunt build` to build the entire project
* `grunt watch` to watch any change in developing

###Recommendation
